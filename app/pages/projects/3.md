## Background/Summary/Problem Statement
I met John, the Executive Director of Chesapeake Commons, through another customer. He asked me, "How can we get staff and volunteers to communicate more so we can get more done?"

At the time, the Commons' partner organizations required volunteers to communicate and submit environmental reports via a web form or an email. John wanted to see what it would look like if mobile apps were introduced.

We focused on solving three specific challenges.

## Outcomes

*Problem:* When staff or volunteers raised an environmental concern, it took the organization a long time to respond.

*Outcome:* Reduce the response time from months to weeks by designing processes that lean on location technology.

## Process
I started by learning who contributed and how they interacted with these organizations. After talking with volunteers, it became apparent that most carried smartphones and wanted to use them more at work. I created paper prototypes for a mobile app, testing them with volunteers. I weeded out potential traps and learned more about users' day-to-day work. I took these findings and created an interactive iOS prototype, testing it with twenty volunteers.
