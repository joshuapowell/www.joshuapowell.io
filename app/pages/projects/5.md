As a team member of Viable, I led the creation of a design system that could scale with the expansion plans of the League.</p><p>Each State and IWLA chapter have specific chemical and biological quality checks that change from ecosystem to ecosystem. I led the team towards a dynamic web form system allows program managers to create collection forms specific to their state and chapter.</p><p>I initiated the creation of an API-first application that allows hundreds of IWLA chapters to create web-based collection forms that cater to their unique data collection needs.</p>",
