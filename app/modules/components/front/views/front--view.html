        I am a designer who thinks in code. I have 13 years experience working
        on internal product teams and collaborating with external teams to bring
        products to market. I am now managing an internal product team that
        consistently launches new Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms. I am
        responsible for organizing and implementing design strategies, web and
        mobile applications, and marketing.
