    "body": "<p>A collection of nonprofit and foundation projects all started at the same time at Viable. Each of the projects had nearly identical use cases and each had a limited budget.</p><p>I conducted market research and spoke with the foundations that funded these nonprofits. From a few key foundations, I was able to raise initial funding to create the Commons Cloud platform.</p><p>I created a simple API that equipped frontend designers and developers with a suite of easy to use tools. These tools allowed them to create custom forms to collect data and build location based web and mobile applications without the need to be a GIS expert or a database administrator.</p>",
