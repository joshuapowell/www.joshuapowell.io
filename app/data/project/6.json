Their goal was to bring their Self Assessment working document out of paper into a globally accessible web application.</p><p>As part of the Viable team I designed a system that allowed for the growth of the Self Assessment with an API-first approach that enables them to add and modify the chapters, questions, and help material that make up the assessment.</p><p>To help them showcase the companies taking part in the Self Assessment, I designed a map that allows each company to show or hide specific company information and share the geographic area they work in.</p>",
