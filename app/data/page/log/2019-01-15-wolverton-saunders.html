            I walked through the thrift store, poking at books and rummaging
            through old boxes. I was there on my wife's request, charged with
            locating two chairs for our living room.
          </p>

            I rounded the corner into the furniture section and quickly glanced
            over the selection of worn out La-Z-Boys, broken IKEA furniture, and
            mismatched dining chairs. Nothing particularly promising.

            Before leaving, I figured I should check the back. Sometimes the
            staff would place recently donated and sometimes better conditioned
            items there. On my way, a warddrobe caught my attention. It was a
            cheap ugly warddrobe but I remembered it from when I was a child.

            I opened the drawers and was greeted with the same musty, wood smell
            as the one that sat in my grandparents room. I opened the closet door
            and found several stickers on the inside. They were brightly colored
            with beautifully detailed hair, slime, and worts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I snagged some photos of the stickers and headed out.

            What I didn't realize was that these were the work of a man that
            some say to be the most polarizing artist in comic history. Yet,
            I had never heard his name.
            ... upon quizzing my son ...

            Basil Wolverton and Norman Saunders created these beatiful little
            works of art. Both men's worked was used by Marvel and the science
            fiction publishing community in the 50s and 60s.

            The detail, colors, and composition of each card is mesmerizing. I
