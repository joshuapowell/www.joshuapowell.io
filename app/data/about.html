Every project I come into contact with is focused on some type of data. Sometimes
that data is information about our environment. Other times it's data about products
and inventory. While still other times it's about where classes or other events are
occurring, who's attending, and how payments are handled.

Regardless of the type of digital product I'm designing, it all boils down to
data input and output.

Human Data Interaction.

Input.

How does the data get into the system? Where is it coming from? Who puts
it there? How often are they interacting with it? Do they get to change it? Do they
change it often?

Output.

Where does the data go after it's "in the system"? How can I get it back out?
How do I create a visualization from the data? How do I show that data back out
to my mobile app, cloud-native app, or website?
