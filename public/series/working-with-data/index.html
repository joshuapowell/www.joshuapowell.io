            An Adventurer’s Guide to Working with Data
          </h1>

        <p class="no-indent">
          I learned about using data to inform business early in my career. I
          had my real awakening while transitioning from a design studio to
          contracting for a startup.
        </p>

        <p>
          The design studio was fast paced but relaxed. I made development
          decisions, but not without the management and design teams
          involvement. Huge marketing teams, car industry affiliates, and
          national non-profits provided data for the projects I worked on. They
          dropped data into my lap. Already cleaned up, already processed, and
          vetted with teams of lawyers. All I had to do was import it into a
          database.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I arrived as a consultant at a 6 month old startup things
          weren't as cheery. The team was well credential. Most everyone was
          from a top 10 computer science, business, or design program.
          Outranked, I felt that I had no business working alongside this
          talented team. Yet, the data they worked with, was not on par with
          what I had gotten comfortable with at the design studio.
        </p>

        <p>
          I had a long, uphill battle ahead of me and after 10 years, I have
          only passed the foothills.

          In this series I will share tips on acquiring open data. I will
          introduce you to open-source tools for transforming your data. We
          will wrap up the series by helping you visualize your data.
        </p>

        <p>
          I look forward to sharing with you. As you have questions along the
