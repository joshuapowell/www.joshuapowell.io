            Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Doesn't have to be Hard

        <p>
          In February, an announcement was posted to the Google Online Security
          Blog telling us that
          <a aria-label="Read Google's 2018 HTTPS Announcement" role="link"
             href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html"
             title="Read Google's 2018 HTTPS Announcement" rel="nofollow">
            as of July 2018 all websites not using HTTPS would be marked as
            “Not Secure”
          </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For those who aren’t up on what this means, let’s stop for a minute
          and give a quick explanation. If your website or application has HTTPS
          in front of your URL, it means that your website has a Secure Sockets
          Layer (SSL) certificate installed on the server. This encrypts the
          traffic between the person requesting your site and the site itself,
          encrypting each transmission between the two. Most people buy these
          from commercial providers like Comodo, DigiCert, Symantec, or from
          their domain registrar and have the certificates installed by IT or
          their web administrator.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sound of a “Not Secure” label on your web property sounds
          terrible. It sounds like Chrome is eroding your credibility. In
          reality, adding this type of simple certificate to your website
          increases the credibility and sets a higher standard for the internet
          as a whole.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have always encouraged our partners to use SSL and in the past 18 months we’ve made it a prerequisite to launching any new application or API. What you quickly notice is that renewing and installing updated SSL certificates is not something that is top of mind. This always leads to one of those “Important, but Not-urgent” items that quickly becomes “Urgent and Important”. We wanted to make this process easier for our partners and so we started searching for a new way of buying and installing our SSL certificates.
        </p>

        <p>
          We started by taking a look at the kinds of certificate authorities the bigger tech companies were using, Google, Github, Shopify, SquareSpace, and more. We found, to no surprise, Google is a Certificate Authority and therefore sign and issue their own SSL Certificates. Github and Shopify were using the same commercial CA that we were using, DigiCert. Finally, we had a look at SquareSpace and found that they were using certificates that were signed by AVG, the popular free Antivirus software. We dug deeper and discovered that Shopify was also using this same solution for the stores using their service.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we turned our focus to finding out where these AVG signed
          certificates were coming from. After some searching and digging
          around we found that these were certificates provided by Let’s
          Encrypt.
          <a aria-label="Read Tech Crunch's Coverage of the Let's Encrypt Launch"
             href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/lets-encrypt-free-https-certification-push-exits-beta/"
             title="Read Tech Crunch's Coverage of the Let's Encrypt Launch"
             rel="nofollow" role="link" >
            We had heard about Let’s Encrypt when it launched in 2016
          </a>, but never gave it a serious look. We started testing these Let’s
          Encrypt certificates on our staging servers and comparing it against
          our existing certificate providers. What we found was that the Let’s
          Encrypt SSL Certificates were better and more secure that the
          certificates we were paying $200-300 per year for.
        </p>

        <p>
          The past 8 months since our switch has flown by and we have switched
          all of our hosted cloud services to the use the Let’s Encrypt
          certificates. Their command line utilities and simple updates allow
          us to maintain control of the process and provide increased security
          to our partners.
        </p>
